# My very own Homebrew tap

This [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/brew-tap.md) repository contains formulas that aren't suitable for homebrew-core (mostly my own stuff like `shortcuts` which isn't popular enought to be hosted in core). You're free to use anything from here; just remember that it comes as-is without any warranty ☠️.

### Tapping around

It's a regular tap so you just

```shell
$ brew tap rodionovd/taps
```

or (if you want to install some formula right away)

```shell
$ brew install rodionovd/taps/shortcuts
```

Please referer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/brew-tap.md) for details on how taps work in general.


Have a nice day!
